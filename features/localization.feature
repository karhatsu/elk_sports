  In order to understand the service
  As a Swedish user
  I want to use the system in Swedish
  
  Scenario: Change language, change page, change the language again
    Given there is a base price 15
    And I am on the home page
    And I follow "P책 svenska"
    Then I should be on the Swedish home page
    And I should see "T채vlingar"
    But I should not see "P책 svenska"
    When I follow "Priser"
    Then I should see "Priser" within ".main_title"
    When I follow "Suomeksi"
    Then I should see "Hinnat" within ".main_title"
    And I should see "P책 svenska"
    But I should not see "Suomeksi"
